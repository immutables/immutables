     * way to configure auto-applied annotations.

     * Please note that standard {@code java.lang} annotations like {@link java.lang.Override},
     * {@link java.lang.Deprecated}, {@link java.lang.SuppressWarnings} will always be applied where
     * supported, so this configuration
     * have no effect on those. At the same time, {@code javax.annotation.*} or

     * type or attribute and then propagated to corresponding/related elements of generated
     * classes, these other mechanisms do not count as complementary annotation generation regulated
     * by this property.
     * <p>
     * Another way to inhibit some classpath entries from discovery is using
     * class-path fence using META-INF extension mechanism. That mechanism is a general classpath
     * discovery blacklist and overrides any whitelist allowed here. Add unwanted fully qualified
     * class name prefixes (for example, like full class names, or package names ending with a dot)
     * as the lines to the {@code META-INF/extensions/org.immutables.inhibit-classpath} resource
     * file available in classpath.
