   * Structural serialization of value types use attribute names, collections, optional values and
   * map into the representation, rather than exact internal fields used to store the data. The
   * important aspect of this is that objects are being deserialized using their constructors and
   * builders, and not the internal representation, thus all singletons, interning and other
   * invariants will be preserved and data migration made possible (using either optional or
   * nullable attributes) or changing types of collections, moving from scalar values to collections
   * etc. Construction using builder and constructor (if builder is disabled) is supported.
   * <p>
   * If {@link Structural} serialization is used and no {@code serialVersionUID} is declared, i.e.
   * {@link Version} annotation is missing, serialized form will have serial version 0L assigned.
